 * @class CostmapToLinesDBSMCCH
 * @brief This class converts the costmap_2d into a set of lines (and points)
 * 
 * The conversion is performed in three stages:
 * 1. Clusters in the costmap are collected using the DBSCAN Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN)
 *    Reference: Ester, Martin; Kriegel, Hans-Peter; Sander, Jörg; Xu, Xiaowei,
 *               A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise. 
 *               Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. AAAI Press. 1996. pp. 226–231. ISBN 1-57735-004-9. 
 *    
 * 2. In the subsequent stage, the convex hull of each cluster is determined using the monotone chain algorithm aka Andrew's algorithm:
 *    C++ implementation example: http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Monotone_Chain_Convex_Hull ( GNU Free Documentation License 1.2 )
 *    Reference:  A. M. Andrew, "Another Efficient Algorithm for Convex Hulls in Two Dimensions", Info. Proc. Letters 9, 216-219 (1979).
 * 
 * 3. In the third step extract lines from each polygon (convex hull) if there exist at least a predefined number of support points.
 * 
 * The output is a container of polygons (but each polygon does only contain a single vertex (point) or two vertices (line)
